# Plutopy [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/160094716.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/160094716)

Welcome to **plutopy**, a community that teaches and promotes reproducible planetary image analysis!

Our primary goal is to serve as a supportive, self-directed learning community aimed at scientists who are interested in producing reproducible analysis of planetary data.

No Git experience is required!

## Can I join plutopy?

If you are interested in any of the following:

- processing and analyzing planetary data in a way that anybody can run and get the same result
- learning new skills to improve the quality and transparency of your work
- sharing your code with the wider planetary science community
- teaching the community the best practices of planetary image data analysis

Then we think you'd be a good fit for the plutopy community!

## What will I learn?

Currently, plutopy is focused on teaching the following skills:

- Git, GitHub and version control
- Planetary image analysis with Python
- Reproducible analysis and plots with Jupyter notebooks
- How to package code so that it can be run on another machine
- ...and more targeted planetary analysis skills coming soon!

## How it works

Learning reproducible science with Plutopy is an entirely self-paced process. You will begin with [a module](https://github.com/cjtu/plutopy/issues/1) to learn the basics of Git, and how to contribute to the main Plutopy repository on GitHub. Then you will be ready to take on new modules, and contribute your solutions to the main Plutopy repository. Each contribution will be reviewed by a community member so that you get feedback on your work before it is added to the repository. Over time, Plutopy will grow into a dynamic resource with several worked examples of different types of planetary data analysis.

## Applying skills to my own work

Plutopy gives you a place to learn a new technique in a supportive and open community. Your contributions to the main repository will be reviewed by other Plutopy contributors so that you receive feedback on your learning. When you feel confident in a new skill, we encourage you to apply it to your own research. You can also use the [issue board](https://github.com/cjtu/plutopy/issues) to ask questions to the community if you get stuck. All examples you find in **plutopy** are open-source (see [License](#License)) and can be edited or adapted for use in your own work. We simply ask that you cite plutopy in any work that uses it to give credit to the contributors (see [CONTRIBUTORS](./CONTRIBUTORS.md) and citable [DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/160094716)).

# The plutopy repository

## Overview

While Plutopy is meant as a teaching community, it also contains a Python data analysis package, also called **plutopy**. The **plutopy** repository will be built upon by collaborators to import, visualize and manipulate an image of Pluto taken by the New Horizons mission in 2015. In building this mock Python package, Plutopy members will learn best practices of collaboration with Git, writing clear Python functions, and reproducible analysis using those functions.

## Tutorial

See the tutorial for the **plutopy** Python package [here](./plutopy/jupyter_notebooks/tutorial.ipynb)

## Data

The image used is the *Pluto New Horizons Global Mosaic 300m July 2017*. The data was collected by [Moore et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05702) and made available by the U.S. Geologic Survey [here](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Pluto/NewHorizons/Pluto_NewHorizons_Global_Mosaic_300m_Jul2017).

The features of interest are stored in the Comma Separated Values (CSV) file format, and were generated by Christian Tai Udovicic.

## Processing

The image handling is done with Python bindings for [GDAL](https://www.gdal.org/index.html), features of interest are read in with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/), the analysis is done with [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/about.html), and the plotting is done with [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). The tutorial and worked examples are written in [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks. All of these packages are installed and managed with the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) package manager.
