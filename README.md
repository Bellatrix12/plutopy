# plutopy
Welcome to **plutopy**! This is a learning library for scientists new to Python, Git, GitHub or all three. 

## Overview
This repository exists to import, visualize and manipulate an image of Pluto taken by the New Horizons mission in 2015. It also exists to help teach how to navigate and contribute to an open-source scientific coding library.

## Example
TODO: Take some screenshots of plutopy in action and add them to the README.

## Tutorial
TODO: Create a full worked example of plutopy in action in a Jupyter notebook, and add a link to the README. 

## Data
The image used is the *Pluto New Horizons Global Mosaic 300m July 2017*. The data was collected by [Moore et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05702) and made vailable by the U.S. Geologic Survey [here](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Pluto/NewHorizons/Pluto_NewHorizons_Global_Mosaic_300m_Jul2017).

The features of interest are stored in the Comma Separated Values (CSV) file format, and were generated by Christian Tai Udovicic.

## Processing
The image handling is done with Python bindings for [GDAL](https://www.gdal.org/index.html), features of interest are read in with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/), the analysis is done with [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/about.html), and the plotting is done with [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). The tutorial is written in a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook. All of these packages are installed with the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) package manager.
